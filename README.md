Caches sulotion for Cumulo and Respo
----

> a caches library as a replacement for memoizations in Cumulo and Respo. It's mostly experimental.

### Usage

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/cumulo/caches.svg)](https://clojars.org/cumulo/caches)

```edn
[cumulo/caches "0.0.1"]
```

```clojure
(caches.core/display-summay!)
```

Methods:

* `(show-summary!)` list entries after formatted
* `(write-cache! params value)` write to cache, `params` supposed to be a collection
* `(access-cache params)` access and return value(or `nil`)
* `(new-loop!)` loop and trigger actions
* `(perform-gc!)` remove entries that are probably no longer useful
* `(reset-caches!)` clear caches for debugging purposes

Storage structure:

```clojure
(defonce *cache-states
  (atom {:loop 0, ; counter
         :caches {}, ; where caches are stored
         :gc {:cold-duration 400, ; wait for N loops before triggering GC
              :trigger-loop 100, ; trigger GC every N loops
              :elapse-loop 50}})) ; entries are considered unuseful after not used for N loops
```
